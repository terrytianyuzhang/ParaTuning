@article{Biddanda:2020aa,
	abstract = {A key challenge in human genetics is to understand the geographic distribution of human genetic variation. Often genetic variation is described by showing relationships among populations or individuals, drawing inferences over many variants. Here, we introduce an alternative representation of genetic variation that reveals the relative abundance of different allele frequency patterns. This approach allows viewers to easily see several features of human genetic structure: (1) most variants are rare and geographically localized, (2) variants that are common in a single geographic region are more likely to be shared across the globe than to be private to that region, and (3) where two individuals differ, it is most often due to variants that are found globally, regardless of whether the individuals are from the same region or different regions. Our variant-centric visualization clarifies the geographic patterns of human variation and can help address misconceptions about genetic differentiation among populations.},

@article{Kang:2019aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many statistics for measuring linkage disequilibrium (LD) take the form of a normalization of the LD coefficient D. Different normalizations produce statistics with different ranges, interpretations, and arguments favoring their use.
METHODS: Here, to compare the mathematical properties of these normalizations, we consider 5 of these normalized statistics, describing their upper bounds, the mean values of their maxima over the set of possible allele frequency pairs, and the size of the allele frequency regions accessible given specified values of the statistics.
RESULTS: We produce detailed characterizations of these properties for the statistics d and œÅ, analogous to computations previously performed for r2. We examine the relationships among the statistics, uncovering conditions under which some of them have close connections.
CONCLUSION: The results contribute insight into LD measurement, particularly the understanding of differences in the features of different LD measures when computed on the same data.},

@article{Rosenberg:2011aa,
	abstract = {Recent studies have produced a variety of advances in the investigation of genetic similarities and differences among human populations. Here, I pose a series of questions about human population-genetic similarities and differences, and I then answer these questions by numerical computation with a single shared population-genetic data set. The collection of answers obtained provides an introductory perspective for understanding key results on the features of worldwide human genetic variation.},

@article{Meuwissen:2001aa,
	abstract = {Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of approximately 50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size N(e) = 100, the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

@article{Lande:1990aa,
	abstract = {Molecular genetics can be integrated with traditional methods of artificial selection on phenotypes by applying marker-assisted selection (MAS). We derive selection indices that maximize the rate of improvement in quantitative characters under different schemes of MAS combining information on molecular genetic polymorphisms (marker loci) with data on phenotypic variation among individuals (and their relatives). We also analyze statistical limitations on the efficiency of MAS, including the detectability of associations between marker loci and quantitative trait loci, and sampling errors in estimating the weighting coefficients in the selection index. The efficiency of artificial selection can be increased substantially using MAS following hybridization of selected lines. This requires initially scoring genotypes at a few hundred molecular marker loci, as well as phenotypic traits, on a few hundred to a few thousand individuals; the number of marker loci scored can be greatly reduced in later generations. The increase in selection efficiency from the use of marker loci, and the sample sizes necessary to achieve them, depend on the genetic parameters and the selection scheme.},
