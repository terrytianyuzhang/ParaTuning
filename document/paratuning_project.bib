abstract = {ABSTRACT Polygenic scores (PGS) summarize the genetic contribution of a person's genotype to a disease or phenotype. They can be used to group participants into different risk categories for diseases, and are also used as covariates in epidemiological analyses. A number of possible ways of calculating PGS have been proposed, and recently there is much interest in methods that incorporate information available in published summary statistics. As there is no inherent information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) in summary statistics, a pertinent question is how we can use LD information available elsewhere to supplement such analyses. To answer this question, we propose a method for constructing PGS using summary statistics and a reference panel in a penalized regression framework, which we call lassosum. We also propose a general method for choosing the value of the tuning parameter in the absence of validation data. In our simulations, we showed that pseudovalidation often resulted in prediction accuracy that is comparable to using a dataset with validation phenotype and was clearly superior to the conservative option of setting the tuning parameter of lassosum to its lowest value. We also showed that lassosum achieved better prediction accuracy than simple clumping and P-value thresholding in almost all scenarios. It was also substantially faster and more accurate than the recently proposed LDpred.},

abstract = {Polygenic risk scores have shown great promise in predicting complex disease risk and will become more accurate as training sample sizes increase. The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning and applying a p value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and can reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred, a method that infers the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the approach of pruning followed by thresholding, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, predicted R2 increased from 20.1% to 25.3% in a large schizophrenia dataset and from 9.8% to 12.0% in a large multiple sclerosis dataset. A similar relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three additional large disease datasets and for non-European schizophrenia samples. The advantage of LDpred over existing methods will grow as sample sizes increase.}

Here, we present PRS-CS, a polygenic prediction method that infers posterior effect sizes of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using genome-wide association summary statistics and an external linkage disequilibrium (LD) reference panel. PRS-CS utilizes a high-dimensional Bayesian regression framework, and is distinct from previous work by placing a continuous shrinkage (CS) prior on SNP effect sizes, which is robust to varying genetic architectures, provides substantial computational advantages, and enables multivariate modeling of local LD patterns. Simulation studies using data from the UK Biobank show that PRS-CS outperforms existing methods across a wide range of genetic architectures, especially when the training sample size is large. We apply PRS-CS to predict six common complex diseases and six quantitative traits in the Partners HealthCare Biobank, and further demonstrate the improvement of PRS-CS in prediction accuracy over alternative methods.},

Often genetic variation is described by showing relationships among populations or individuals, drawing inferences over many variants. Here, we introduce an alternative representation of genetic variation that reveals the relative abundance of different allele frequency patterns. This approach allows viewers to easily see several features of human genetic structure: (1) most variants are rare and geographically localized, (2) variants that are common in a single geographic region are more likely to be shared across the globe than to be private to that region, and (3) where two individuals differ, it is most often due to variants that are found globally, regardless of whether the individuals are from the same region or different regions. Our variant-centric visualization clarifies the geographic patterns of human variation and can help address misconceptions about genetic differentiation among populations.},

@article{Marquez-Luna:2021,
	abstract = {Polygenic risk prediction is a widely investigated topic because of its promising clinical applications. Genetic variants in functional regions of the genome are enriched for complex trait heritability. Here, we introduce a method for polygenic prediction, LDpred-funct, that leverages trait-specific functional priors to increase prediction accuracy. We fit priors using the recently developed baseline-LD model, including coding, conserved, regulatory, and LD-related annotations. We analytically estimate posterior mean causal effect sizes and then use cross-validation to regularize these estimates, improving prediction accuracy for sparse architectures. We applied LDpred-funct to predict 21 highly heritable traits in the UK Biobank (avg N = 373 K as training data). LDpred-funct attained a +4.6\% relative improvement in average prediction accuracy (avg prediction R2 = 0.144; highest R2 = 0.413 for height) compared to SBayesR (the best method that does not incorporate functional information). For height, meta-analyzing training data from UK Biobank and 23andMe cohorts (N = 1107 K) increased prediction R2 to 0.431. Our results show that incorporating functional priors improves polygenic prediction accuracy, consistent with the functional architecture of complex traits.},

@article{Prive:2020,
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Polygenic scores have become a central tool in human genetics research. LDpred is a popular method for deriving polygenic scores based on summary statistics and a matrix of correlation between genetic variants. However, LDpred has limitations that may reduce its predictive performance.
RESULTS: Here we present LDpred2, a new version of LDpred that addresses these issues. We also provide two new options in LDpred2: a "sparse" option that can learn effects that are exactly 0, and an "auto" option that directly learns the two LDpred parameters from data. We benchmark predictive performance of LDpred2 against the previous version on simulated and real data, demonstrating substantial improvements in robustness and predictive accuracy compared to LDpred1. We then show that LDpred2 also outperforms other polygenic score methods recently developed, with a mean AUC over the 8 real traits analyzed here of 65.1\%, compared to 63.8\% for lassosum, 62.9\% for PRS-CS and 61.5\% for SBayesR. Note that LDpred2 provides more accurate polygenic scores when run genome-wide, instead of per chromosome.
AVAILABILITY: LDpred2 is implemented in R package bigsnpr.

@article{Prive:2019,
	abstract = {Polygenic prediction has the potential to contribute to precision medicine. Clumping and thresholding (C+T) is a widely used method to derive polygenic scores. When using C+T, several p value thresholds are tested to maximize predictive ability of the derived polygenic scores. Along with this p value threshold, we propose to tune three other hyper-parameters for C+T. We implement an efficient way to derive thousands of different C+T scores corresponding to a grid over four hyper-parameters. For example, it takes a few hours to derive 123K different C+T scores for 300K individuals and 1M variants using 16 physical cores. We find that optimizing over these four hyper-parameters improves the predictive performance of C+T in both simulations and real data applications as compared to tuning only the p value threshold. A particularly large increase can be noted when predicting depression status, from an AUC of 0.557 (95\% CI: [0.544-0.569]) when tuning only the p value threshold to an AUC of 0.592 (95\% CI: [0.580-0.604]) when tuning all four hyper-parameters we propose for C+T. We further propose stacked clumping and thresholding (SCT), a polygenic score that results from stacking all derived C+T scores. Instead of choosing one set of hyper-parameters that maximizes prediction in some training set, SCT learns an optimal linear combination of all C+T scores by using an efficient penalized regression. We apply SCT to eight different case-control diseases in the UK biobank data and find that SCT substantially improves prediction accuracy with an average AUC increase of 0.035 over standard C+T.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many statistics for measuring linkage disequilibrium (LD) take the form of a normalization of the LD coefficient D. Different normalizations produce statistics with different ranges, interpretations, and arguments favoring their use.
METHODS: Here, to compare the mathematical properties of these normalizations, we consider 5 of these normalized statistics, describing their upper bounds, the mean values of their maxima over the set of possible allele frequency pairs, and the size of the allele frequency regions accessible given specified values of the statistics.
RESULTS: We produce detailed characterizations of these properties for the statistics d and ρ, analogous to computations previously performed for r2. We examine the relationships among the statistics, uncovering conditions under which some of them have close connections.
CONCLUSION: The results contribute insight into LD measurement, particularly the understanding of differences in the features of different LD measures when computed on the same data.},

Here, I pose a series of questions about human population-genetic similarities and differences, and I then answer these questions by numerical computation with a single shared population-genetic data set.

@article{Meuwissen:2001aa,
	abstract = {Recent advances in molecular genetic techniques will make dense marker maps available and genotyping many individuals for these markers feasible. Here we attempted to estimate the effects of approximately 50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to finite population size N(e) = 100, the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.},

@article{Lande:1990aa,
	abstract = {Molecular genetics can be integrated with traditional methods of artificial selection on phenotypes by applying marker-assisted selection (MAS). We derive selection indices that maximize the rate of improvement in quantitative characters under different schemes of MAS combining information on molecular genetic polymorphisms (marker loci) with data on phenotypic variation among individuals (and their relatives). We also analyze statistical limitations on the efficiency of MAS, including the detectability of associations between marker loci and quantitative trait loci, and sampling errors in estimating the weighting coefficients in the selection index. The efficiency of artificial selection can be increased substantially using MAS following hybridization of selected lines. This requires initially scoring genotypes at a few hundred molecular marker loci, as well as phenotypic traits, on a few hundred to a few thousand individuals; the number of marker loci scored can be greatly reduced in later generations. The increase in selection efficiency from the use of marker loci, and the sample sizes necessary to achieve them, depend on the genetic parameters and the selection scheme.},
