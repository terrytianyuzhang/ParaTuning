#####Pipeline for parameter tuning

step1: fit the combined lassosum estimator using training data as usual.
    tianyu-combined-lassosum-training.R

step2: choose one small-ish lambda,
    use the corresponding hatbeta to generate bootstrap data sets.

    generate-boot-data.R

step3: use the bootstrap data to train several (number = repeats of bootstrap)
    combined lasso models.

    combined-lassosum-boot-training.R

step4: use the bootstrap data dn bootstrap models to decide which lambda to use

    estimate-cov.R
