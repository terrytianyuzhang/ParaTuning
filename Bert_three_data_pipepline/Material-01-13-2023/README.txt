TianyU:

 

The transfer learning has finished. In my hands it does not seem to perform as good as the joint lasso sum in terms of AUC. In fact it has a hard time out-performing the weighted lassosum in terms of AUC.

 

In the drobox that we have been using there is a directory Material-01-13-2023. This contains two functions starting with my. They are modified versions of the ones that you gave me and should be used instead of your functions from github. There is also a LS-pipeline-functions.R and a TL-risk-score-pipeline.R, these are similar to what you have seen before with the PnT and LS in that they calculate the PRS using the transfer learning approach. Finally there are two RData files. One with all the results and the other with the PRS for the YRI testing set. The last file collect-results-Tianyu.R and it collect the information that is in the results .RData.

 

I hope I gave you everything that you need.

 

Enjoy.
